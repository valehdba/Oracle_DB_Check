The first script utilizes three views:
• v$session: Contains information about active sessions in the database.
• v$sort_segment_usage: Shows temporary segment usage by session for sorting
operations.
• v$sql_id: Stores information about SQL statements executed by sessions (optional, for
joining with sql_id if desired).
Explanation:
• The script filters for ACTIVE sessions (s.status) that are currently using temporary space
(seg.bytes > 0).
• It joins the v$session and v$sort_segment_usage views based on the session_id to
associate session information with temporary segment usage.
• The script retrieves the following information:
o s.username: Username of the session owner.
o s.sid: Session ID.
o s.serial#: Serial number of the session.
o s.sql_id: (Optional) SQL ID of the statement using temporary space (requires
joining with v$sql_id).
o seg.segment_type: Type of temporary segment (e.g., 'SORT', 'HASH').
o seg.bytes / 1024 / 1024 AS used_mb: Total temporary space used by the session
in megabytes (MB).
o seg.bytes_used / 1024 / 1024 AS used_in_sort_mb: Space used by the session
specifically for sorting operations in MB.
